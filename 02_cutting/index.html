#### Week 2: 2D Cutting 


<h4 style="font-size:30px;background-color:lightpink; color:white; font-family: helvetica"> 1ST ASSIGNMENT</h4>

For this week's assignment we had to create press fit construction kit that could be able to be assembled in different ways so that we could then send it to a laser cut. It had to be done so that the pieces could be stay together, but not glue or other material could be used to pull them together. 

<h4> - Brainstorming design </h4>

Although I started with no design in mind, it drastically changed when took a paper and a pencil and started drawing the figure I wanted to achieve by using the lasercut. First, I thought of creating a sort of animal with different shapes, but didnt felt that much inspiration. So, i decided to try to do a pencil holder why rectangles. 
Now, I will be showing the different steps I had to do before reaching my goal.

<h4> - Step 1 | Learn  How to Use Fusion 360 </h4>

Before I coul start, I needed several youtube videos and pdfs to learn how to use fusion 360 and the diverse techiques that I would need to apply to my design. For that, I started by doing a simple shape provided in an example. Once I felt confidence, I began my project.

<h4> - Step 2 | Design the Model </h4>

I decided to do a sort of wheel with eight notvhes of about 1.90mm. The first thing I did was to create a sketch and draw a circle in the top plane that had a diameter of 50mm. Once I had this, I created the offLines along the vertical and horizontal axes. The, I mirror them and extrude it with the thickness of the cardboard, which was the material I will be using, which was 3.8 mmm. Then saved it as a dfx and went to the lasercurt.

<h4> - Step 3 | Cutting </h4>



<h4> - Step 4 | Assembly </h4>

<h4> Final Result </h4>
For the final results, I think that it definetely wwent as expected, as it not only was able to assembled in multiple ways, but also fit perfectly one with each other. Below, I have attached a picture of the final resultassembled in two different ways. 



<h4 style="font-size:30px;background-color:lightpink; color:white; font-family: helvetica"> 2ND ASSIGNMENT</h4>
For this next assignment, we had to chooe two objects from the lab and model them in Fusion 360.


<h4> - first object </h4>
So, for my first object I decided to model a screwdriver. I started by doing the body in the form of a cylinder, and then continue on to create the holder and eventually the screw. My screw driver was 5.5mmm.  Below, I have attached a picture of how it is simmulated. 



<h4> - second object </h4>
For this second object, I did a model of a water bottle. I began by making circles and then filleting the bottom part of the water bottle and then created a hole in the top part as representing it was open. Then, I added some decorative elements such as giving a sense of glass of color gold and black. Below, I have attached a picture of how it is simmulated.
