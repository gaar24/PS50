#### Week 2: 2D Cutting 


<img width="225" height= "300" src="./02_cutting/cut.png" alt="cutting"/>

<h4> Overview</h4>

For this week's assignment we had to create press fit construction kit that could be able to be assembled in different ways so that we could then send it to a laser cut. It had to be done so that the pieces could be stay together, but not glue or other material could be used to pull them together. 

<h4> Brainstorming design </h4>

Although I started with no design in mind, it drastically changed when took a paper and a pencil and started drawing the figure I wanted to achieve by using the lasercut. First, I thought of creating a sort of animal with different shapes, but didnt felt that much inspiration. So, i decided to try to do a pencil holder why rectangles. 
Now, I will be showing the different steps I had to do before reaching my goal.

<h4>Step 1 | Learn  How to Use Fusion 360 </h4>

Before I coul start, I needed several youtube videos and pdfs to learn how to use fusion 360 and the diverse techiques that I would need to apply to my design. For that, I started by doing a simple shape provided in an example. Once I felt confidence, I began my project-
