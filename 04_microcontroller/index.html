#### Week 1: Introduction 



<h4 style="font-size:30px;background-color:lightpink; color:white; font-family: helvetica"> ASSIGNMENT</h4>

For this week's assignment, we had to program an Arduino board to do something. It should include a code snippets in the documentation, a drawn schematic of the circuit using hand sketch, flastad or others. 

<h4> Concept </h4>
I decided to program an Arduino Board that performs a fucntion that is not associated to my kinetic structure. This decision was mainly based for me to undertsand better arduino and further expand my knowldege in it so that i am able to later do more challenges projects that involves the use of other mechanisms. 

I decided to code for two LEDs that could work woth two pushbuttons, so when i press one of the pushbuttons, the LEDs brights and when is released it turns off. 

To do this I needed:
- two LEDs
- two pushbuttons
- four resistors 
- ten wires 

<h4> Schematic </h4>

this is the schematic of my circuit.


<h4> Code </h4>


//values that wont't be changed 

const int BUTTON1 = 2;
const int BUTTON2 = 4;
const int LED1 = 8;
const int LED2 = 12;
int BUTTONstate1 = 0;
int BUTTONstate2 = 0;

// setup only run once. components of the circuit. 
void setup()
{
pinMode(BUTTON1, INPUT);
pinMode(BUTTON2, INPUT);
pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT);
pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);
}
// code will be excecuted here. give commands to the breadboard.
void loop()
{
BUTTONstate1 = digitalRead(BUTTON1);
if (BUTTONstate1 == HIGH)
{
digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
}
else{
digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);
}
BUTTONstate2 = digitalRead(BUTTON2);
if (BUTTONstate2 == HIGH)
{
digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH);
}
else{
digitalWrite(LED2, LOW);
}
}

 when button 1is pressed, then LED 1 will be turn on , but if the statement inside the if is wronng then LED 1 will be turn off. Now, if button 2 is pressed, then LED 2 will 
//be turn on but if the staement in the if confition is wrong, the LED 2 remains closes 


<h4> Testing its Effectiveness </h4>

Before doing the circuit with two LEDs and pushbuttons, I first did a circuit with only one, but wntedto challenge myself and see how two would work and how the code would change in response to the addition of commmands.
Below, I have attached a video and an image of the final circuit.
