#### Week 1: Introduction

<h1> First Proposal </h1>
This week's assignment was to brainstorm ideas for my final project. For that, I started by figuring out something I would be most passioante about. Later, I thought of the challenge part that could be involved in my mechanism. My first idea, was to create a phone charger with a solar pannel implemented so that the battery could be easily charge while being in the road or miles away from home. The way it would work is that it will be a small device in a circular shape where instead of a wire attached to the phone, the phone would be charged by placing the phone on the surface of the charger. Below I attached an image on how the design would look like, s well as its correspodning implememtation.

<h2> Second Proposal </h2>
My second idea was to build an automatic water system. I believe that sometimes there is not enough time to get the plants watered, and thta could led to catastrophes. For that, I thought of  adding as potw here the tubes areconnected through it in a way that seems to give water. It would be a simulation of how it will distribute the water, and the times it will lastand stop.
